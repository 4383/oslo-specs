  This template should be in ReSTructured text.  For help with syntax,
  see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

  To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see:
  http://rst.ninjs.org

  The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL,
  for example a URL of
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oslo?searchtext=awesome-thing should be
  named awesome-thing.rst.

  For specs targeted at a single project, please prefix the first line
  of your commit message with the name of the project.  For example,
  if you're submitting a new feature for oslo.config, your git commit
  message should start something like: "config: My new feature".

  Wrap text at 79 columns.

  Do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None

  If you would like to provide a diagram with your spec, ascii diagrams are
  required.  http://asciiflow.com/ is a very nice tool to assist with making
  ascii diagrams.  The reason for this is that the tool used to review specs is
  based purely on plain text.  Plain text will allow review to proceed without
  having to look at additional files which can not be viewed in gerrit.  It
  will also allow inline feedback on the diagram itself.
