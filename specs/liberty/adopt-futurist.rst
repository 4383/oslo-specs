 Adopting futurist
===================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/oslo.utils/+spec/adopt-futurist

The goal of this library would be to provide a well documented
`futures`_ classes/utilities/additions that start of with the a basic set
and can expand into a larger set as time goes on. This library (and the
futures library/module in general) allows for providing a level of
transparency in how asynchronous work gets executed.

This library currently adds on the following (going above and beyond
the built-in futures library in python 3.2 or newer and
the `futures backport`_ that is commonly used on python 2.6 or 2.7).

- Statistics gathering (number of futures ran, average failure rate, average
  run time...)
- An eventlet executor (aka a ``GreenThreadPoolExecutor``) that uses a
  `eventlet`_ greenpool and greenthreads (making the same futures/executor
  interface work when running in an eventlet environment). This kind of
  addition makes it eas(ier) to move from eventlet to another style of
  executor (since the interface that is provided/used is the same as the
  other executor types).
- A synchronous executor (aka a ``SynchronousExecutor``) that does **not**
  using any pools, threads, or processes but executes the submitted function
  in the calling thread (or program) and returns a future with the result or
  exception set. This allows for blocking usage where for whatever reason the
  same executor/futures interface is desired but executing in
  threads, processes (or other) is **not** desired.

Some of the current/planned usages for it (that are being actively pursued):

* Internal usage in `taskflow`_ (when no executor object is provided
  by a user). Also used for *internal* retry activation (that itself uses a
  synchronous executor).
* Internal usage in `oslo.messaging`_ (replacing/augmenting/unifying the
  executor interface inside that codebase).

The code for this library was/has been extracted from `taskflow`_ and is
desired to be used by `oslo.messaging`_ (and hopefully others)?
